            <p>This is a test bench for my Angular work where I practice and develop new ideas. I build custom
                UI components, REST applications, and abstract applications. According to Angular's
                documentation: "Angular is an application-design framework and development platform for creating
                efficient and sophisticated single-page apps."</p>
